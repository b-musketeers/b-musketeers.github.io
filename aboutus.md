**Who are we?**
<br>
The â‚¿-Musketeers are simply a collective of individuals with a common interest. We meet regularly to discuss what is happening in the world around us and can often be found consuming content/ideas that relate to Bitcoin, Economics, Technology, Privacy and everything in-between. This website is a means by which we wish to give back to a community that has provided a wealth of information to us and, hopefully, to help others find signal in the noise.
